# Milestone-Project-Third-Age-Total-War

The project aim is to publicize and give information on the Third Age overhaul mod for Medieval 2 Total War. 
While the original game is well advertised and widely available there are not many places other than the download page that 
information on the mod itself can be found and as an amateur made free to download mod it is not as widely or as well portrayed to the public.
With images and content associated with the mod also being amateur in style the site became quite rustic in looks. The site contains an overview of 
the mod itself as well as links to both social and download pages for the mod, original game and links to the Total War associated sites. This should
both boost mod usage and downloads while also increasing traffic to social pages and the Total War parent company site. 

UX
The main users of this game will be people who already possess the Medieval 2 Total War game and are looking for information about the mod. This 
will likely include lord of the rings fans and gamers, hence the amount of lord of the rings lore and media is extensive and meant to drive engagement.
Besides this there will also be users who have never played the original Medieval total war but are interested in Lord of the Rings or vice versa.
gamers that have never seen Lord of the Rings. There may also be some who do not fit into any category and who have never gamed or seen Lord of the Rings,
but are interested in knowing more. This site should provide information to all groups in a user friendly manner. 







In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The menu will provide navigation to the various parts of the project including the faction pages, contact page, home page and download link. 
It also has a logo that returns to the home page.
2. Hero Gif
The hero GIF at the start is the in game version of the Charge of the Rohirrim one of the iconic scenes of the movie and right away will grab fans.

The modal will provide information and links to both download pages for the parent game and mod.
4. Gallery
The gallery slideshow will show iconic recreations of different locations from the movies in the game.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z


For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
