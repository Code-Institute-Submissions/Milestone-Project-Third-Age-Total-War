# Milestone-Project-Third-Age-Total-War

The project aim is to publicize and give information on the Third Age overhaul mod for Medieval 2 Total War. 
While the original game is well advertised and widely available there are not many places other than the download page that 
information on the mod itself can be found and as an amateur made free to download mod it is not as widely or as well portrayed to the public.
With images and content associated with the mod also being amateur in style the site became quite rustic in looks. The site contains an overview of 
the mod itself as well as links to both social and download pages for the mod, original game and links to the Total War associated sites. This should
both boost mod usage and downloads while also increasing traffic to social pages and the Total War parent company site. 

UX
The main users of this game will be people who already possess the Medieval 2 Total War game and are looking for information about the mod. This 
will likely include lord of the rings fans and gamers, hence the amount of lord of the rings lore and media is extensive and meant to drive engagement.
Besides this there will also be users who have never played the original Medieval total war but are interested in Lord of the Rings or vice versa.
gamers that have never seen Lord of the Rings. There may also be some who do not fit into any category and who have never gamed or seen Lord of the Rings,
but are interested in knowing more. This site should provide information to all groups in a user friendly manner. There may also be aspiring mod developers that want to 
learn more about mod creation, gain ideas and possibly contact the creator of this particular mod.

Feature 9 - allows users to navigate to relevant social pages to find more information about the companies involved in the parent game and mod, by clicking the social links at the bottom of each page. 


Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea was to add a direct file download and guide to installation, not just links to pages where this is available.
 This would require file hosting and 
a rundown of the method for installation

Another feature idea was to include gameplay videos, as there are many amateur youtube gamers that play the mod this would boost interaction
 and would give new users
who have never seen the mod more of a feel of the direct gameplay. 

Another feature idea was to add a review section as this mod was nominated for mod of the year 09,10 and is largely popular among users
 and displaying these would boost user engagement and provide feedback to the creators.

Another feature idea was to add more media of direct gameplay including videos and images, however this would require better rendering
 than I have available. 

Another feature idea was an article or blogs page about gaming articles that user may find interesting although not directly linked 
to the mod would boost engagement and site traffic. 

Another feature idea was to add a link to twitch streaming servers/ to have imbedded streams of players who play the game, either live
 or recorded again increasing awareness as such streamers would likely mention the mod site while playing. 

Another feature idea for the factions pages was to add a gallery in more of a photo grid style of some of the units from each faction to show user
more gameplay elements. Again would require proper rendering.

Responsive Design Elements

Mobile Size:

Home page-
Navbar is condensed to menu button that then has dropdown of nav item elements
Title logo now takes up full width of screen.
Text overlay on hero gif is no longer set to hover.
Modal Button takes up nearly full screen width.
Social links set to 2 per row instead of all 4.

Good Factions Page and Evil Factions Page-
Navbar is condensed to menu button that then has dropdown of nav item elements
Title logo now takes up full width of screen.
Individual faction logo and descriptive text set to 1 per row instead of 3.
Fontsizes altered for mobile
Social links set to 2 per row instead of all 4.

Contact Page
Navbar is condensed to menu button that then has dropdown of nav item elements
Title logo now takes up full width of screen.
Hero image resized and padding removed.
Social links set to 2 per row instead of all 4.


Ipad and Ipad pro:
Although largely similar to desktop some small format changes added along with natural font and 
padding alterations and on 'good.html' and 'evil.html' factions pages, faction logo and descriptions are 2 per row so still easily readable. 

Bugs

For mobile sizes there is a wierd margin on the right, that is not affected by padding or 
any CSS code when inspected. Could be something to do with the actual screen size on iphone being 
slightly more than the physical viewport as page can be dragged central and then looks as it should,
however worth mentioning here. 

Noted that when changing from desktop to tablet and mobile the change caused slow alteration of taskbar height in logo area due to  ease-in-out transition.
Not ideal but after the transition finishes layout format still looks good. Likewise with hero gif on main page
transition is slower than the duration given and makes the whole page kind of 'clunky' until it is over.


Deployment
Began with the index page, creating the navbar, with logos, and social links appling all relevant links to libraries and 
tool (bootstrap, fontawesome, etc).
Fully formated navbar and links using CSS and copied to other 3 pages ('evil.html', 'good.html', 'contact.html')
Created gif using intro video and giphy and gather related content from in game and online (images).
Created modal and carousel using help from links (commented out in code) and adivise from tutor. Orginally, carousel was going to be photo grid
but more impact with carousel. 
Added modal content and text overlay to hero gif. Originally text overlay was less but increased size and 
then added hover effect to give more detailed context on website. 

Completed 'evil.html' and 'good.html' using similar styles to make user friendly and easier to understand. Added map to give context of starting locations
of each faction and to increase engagement specifically for fans of the LotR (Lord of the Rings. Descriptions were made as short and as detailed as possible 
giving some backstory and context (users who tested were LotR fans already and yet found there were things they didn't
 know before even though descriptions were short). Originally was going to have photo grid gallery of each faction but realised there is not a lot
of content online pertaining to factions and much had to be created from actual gameplay. So went with Map instead as more context given. 

Finally moved on to contact page, adding hero image and form elements, but kept simple. 

Process for each page in terms of responsive design was the same. Elements were created in mobile view and then worked upwards using media querys in CSS
to alter. This meant elements such as the menu dropdown were added early on meaning there would be less chance of them causing issues when adding later
(issues such as, formatting, layout, etc).

The github branch is origin in the Milestone-Project-Third-Age-Total-War directory. No other branches were used and for local running of code enter
python3 -m http.server.
