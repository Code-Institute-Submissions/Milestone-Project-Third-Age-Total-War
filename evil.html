				<h2> The Forces of the Dark Lord of Mordor</h2>
				<p>The forces of darkness seek for total dominion over all life. Sauron,

					purpose. Not just Trolls and Orcs but scores of
					Evil Men make up Saurons legions and all will answer his call.
					Play as the evil forces of the world and seek to destroy and dominate the forces of Good.

				<h3>Mordor</h3>
				<p>Gondor, the Southern Kingdom of the Númenóreans – founded in the Second Age by Elendil, and ruled by
					his sons Isildur and Anárion.
					After the death of Isildur at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, Gondor fell on hard times. With
					the return of the Dark Lord of Mordor,
					and Gondor so close to darkness can the enemy be pushed back and finally defeated.

				<h3>Isengard</h3>
				<p>The Valley of Dale lies directly south of the Lonely Mountain and overlooks the Long Lake. Destroyed
					by the Dragon Smaug on his ruinous path to Erebor the survivors fled South to live with the lake-men
					of Esgaroth.
					In 2941 Bard the Bowman, heir to the throne of Dale, shot and killed the dragon, Smaug and allied
					with dwarves of the Iron Hills and Elves from the Woodland Realm defeated the armies of Orcs and
					Wargs at the battle of the Five Armies.

				<h3>Orcs of the Misty Mountains</h3>
				<p>The Kingdom of Rohan was established in the Third Age, when the cavalry forces of the Kingdom of
					Rhovanion came to Gondors aid in destroying an army Easterlings
					and forced them to flee beyond Greenwood the Great. These Northmen were the Horse-People who called
					themselves Eotheod but by the elves they were known as the Rohirrim (people of the horse).
					In return for there aid, Gondor bestowed upon them the lands between the Rivers Isen and Anduin, the
					land that came to be known as Rohan.

				<h3>Orcs of Gundabad</h3>
				<p> The Lands between the Misty Mountains and the Blue Mountains are named Eriador. In the year 3320 of
					the Second Age, Elendil established the Northern Kingdom of Numenor - Arnor.
					After the battle of the Last Alliance and the death of Elendil and his son Anarion, this land fell
					into decline due to civil strife and later the war with Angmar and the Witch-king.
					In 1974 the Witch-King destroyed the capital at Fornost and with it the last of the Dunedain in the
					North. Only a part of the Dunedain led by Aradart descendent of Isildur survived
					to live in hiding. His descendents still live among the peaceful folk of Eriador, ranging the lands
					and keeping its people safe from evil, awaiting the day they might return to greatness.

				<h3>Harad</h3>
				<p>Doriath, the hidden kingdom, was the greatest of the Sindarin realms in Beleriand, but during the
					wars it was destroyed. Many of those who survived fled east past the towering peaks of the
					Hithaeglir
					into the lands where the Tawarwait, Silvan Elves, long sundered from the elves of Beleriand,
					dwelled. Being a rustic people lesser in wisdom, the silvans
					took the Sindar as their lords. During the Last Alliance of Men and Elves these lords Amdir and
					Oropher were slain along with most of their great host.
					Thranduil, son of Oropher led his people North his heart full of disquiet and dissillusionment and
					established the Woodland Realm. There he delved a great underground fortress.
					The lord and lady of the Wood of Lothlorien took up guardianship of that realm. There the hardy but
					less well equipped Eastern elves stand as a fortress against the encroaching darkness. The Silvan
					Elves are unmatched in their skill with a bow and their hatred of Sauron runs deep.

				<h3>Rhun</h3>
				<p>After the destruction of Beleriand the Noldor, and Sindar who followed them, passed to Lindon and
					Eregion and established Mithlond, the Grey Havens.
					Sauron deceived the elves of Eregion into the creation of the Rings of Power. After his creation of
					the One ring the elves perceived his malice and hid the Three Elven Rings.
					In return Sauron destroyed Eregion and slew Celebrimbor the leader of the Elves in this region.
					Survivors led by Elrond Halfelven established Imladris or Rivendell in the foothills of the Misty
					Mountain.
					With the help of the Men of Numenor in the Last Alliance Sauron was defeated, although the power of
					the Noldor was greatly diminished.
					Today the realms of Mithlond and Imladris have but a whisper of their old glory and longer have the
					strength to openly march against the resurgent power of Mordor. The valor of the elves has not
					diminished however and
					by their vigilance the land East of the Misty Mountains are kept safe.
