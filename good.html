				<h3>The Kingdom of Rohan</h3>
				<p>The Kingdom of Rohan was established in the Third Age, when the cavalry forces of the Kingdom of Rhovanion came to Gondors aid in destroying an army Easterlings
                and forced them to flee beyond Greenwood the Great. These Northmen were the Horse-People who called themselves Eotheod but by the elves they were known as the Rohirrim (people of the horse).
                In return for there aid, Gondor bestowed upon them the lands between the Rivers Isen and Anduin, the land that came to be known as Rohan.

				<h3>The Free Peoples of Eriador</h3>
				<p> The Lands between the Misty Mountains and the Blue Mountains are named Eriador. In the year 3320 of the Second Age, Elendil established the Northern Kingdom of Numenor - Arnor.
                After the battle of the Last Alliance and the death of Elendil and his son Anarion, this land fell into decline due to civil strife and later the war with Angmar and the Witch-king. 
                In 1974 the Witch-King destroyed the capital at Fornost and with it the last of the Dunedain in the North. Only a part of the Dunedain led by Aradart descendent of Isildur survived
                to live in hiding. His descendents still live among the peaceful folk of Eriador, ranging the lands and keeping its people safe from evil, awaiting the day they might return to greatness.

			<h3>The Dwarves</h3>
			<p>After the destruction of the great Dwarven settlements of Nagrod and Belegost at the end of the First Age and the loss of Khazad Dum by the Balrog in 1980,
            the Dwarves fell into decay. Only after the death of Smaug and the reclamation of Erebor by the dwarves of the Iron Hills did the ressurection of the tired nation begin. 
            Balin, one of the great Dwarven Princes has sworn to return to Khazad Dum and musters troops to reclaim Moria. To the South, the Men of Dale have proven to be loyal allies
            to the Dwarves and can be counted on to help. Dwarven armies consist of heavy infantry armed with axes and battle-hammers. They are deadly at short distances.
